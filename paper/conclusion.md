# Conclusion

Event‑driven agentic memory provides a pragmatic path to reliable, observable conversational systems. A modular Gateway + Bridge with hybrid retrieval can deliver better recall under token budgets and clearer operational behavior than monolithic agents. Suites A-C validate the sufficiency claim that event-driven, tiered memory supports recall, robustness, and replay under fixed budgets and bounded load. We release a reproducible artifact and CI gates to encourage comparable systems research.
