# Limitations

- Retrieval hygiene and entity normalization can dominate outcomes.
- Vector/graph tiers increase operational complexity and depend on retrieval hygiene
  and schema quality (kept optional).
- Model/tokenization sensitivity; budgets reported and bounded.
Summaries and long-context processing can drift or hallucinate, which bounds the reliability
of summary tiers under long horizons. <!--CLAIM:PA6-->
