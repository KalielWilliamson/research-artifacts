Event-driven agent systems must recall information across turns while remaining reliable
under load and observable in production. We argue the following: <!--CLAIM:C4-->
We study an event-sourced architecture that decouples IO, memory, and reasoning, and evaluate
whether tiered memory improves recall under fixed token budgets while preserving tail latency
and replayability. <!--CLAIM:C1--> <!--CLAIM:C2--> <!--CLAIM:C3-->
We release reproducible artifacts including event logs, metrics, tables, and plots, enabling
end-to-end replay and comparison of system behavior.
